# Page types
- entity — a concrete component or role in the system; must declare a kind field
- concept — an abstract design idea (system architecture, module boundaries, data flow, deployment model, permission model, evaluation framework, etc.)
- source — one summary page per ingested source document; must declare a source_type field
Other types (comparison, synthesis, etc.) may be created as needed.
